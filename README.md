# some random scripts i wrote

i'm a newbe scripter, so any advice/correction is welcomed! ðŸ˜Š

## [aliases](https://github.com/xVss/scripts/blob/master/aliases)

some simple oneliners

## [bookmarks](https://github.com/xVss/scripts/blob/master/bookmarks)

a **browser-independent** simple bookmark script that saves your favourite URLs in a file using the system clipboard and open them back using *rofi*

## [rofi-paste](./rofi-paste)
a little script that manages a _personal_ clipboard where you can save and recover stuff.

one day i needed to try some payloads in gdb, but got tired of choosing the one i wanted with mouse from the clipboard history, so i made this script. hope the gifs explain better what i mean.
