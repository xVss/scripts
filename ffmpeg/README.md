# ffmpeg

i don't have a powerful PC ðŸ˜® using OBS or anything else to record my screen is too resource demanding.

So i made some ffmpeg scripts to solve my problems ðŸ˜Ž

They are written specifically for me (and not formatted for readability), but maybe you can use them as a reference for something you want to do.

- [lapse](./lapse) - Record some frames a second to make a timelapse video
- [lapse2screens](./lapse2screens) - Same as before, but this time i overlay my second monitor over my main monitor (as you can see in gifs on this repo's main [README](../README.md)
- [mk2daylapse](./mk2daylapse) - Takes all the timelapses recorded during the day and concatenate them
- [rec2k](./rec2k) - Record my main monitor
- [rek2kcam](./rec2kcam) - Record my main monitor with microphone input and webcam overlay
- [rek2kmic](./rec2kmic) - Record my main monitor with microphone input
- [rec2screens](./rec2screens) - Record my main monitor with second monitor overlay
- [stop_recording](./stop_recording) - Find the PID of a running ffmpeg capture and stops it
